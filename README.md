# Image Classification using PyTorch

This repository contains a Python implementation of an image classification model using deep learning techniques on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. The goal is to demonstrate how deep learning can be applied to solve problems that traditional programming methods cannot easily handle. In this project, a simple neural network model is created, trained, and evaluated using PyTorch.

## Project Objectives

- Understand how deep learning can solve problems traditional programming methods cannot.
- Learn about the [MNIST handwritten digits dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
- Use the [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html) library to load the MNIST dataset and prepare it for training.
- Build a simple neural network for image classification.
- Train the neural network using the MNIST dataset.
- Evaluate the performance of the trained neural network.
